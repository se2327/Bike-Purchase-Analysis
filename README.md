#  My Excel Project:- Bike-Purchase-Analysis
📁 Repository: bike-purchase-analysis
🧠 Project by: Easha
📌 Status: Completed | 📈 Skill Focus: Excel Dashboards, Data Visualization, Basic VBA

📖 Project Summary...
In this project, I have created an Excel dashboard using a dataset related to bike purchases by customers. The purpose of this dashboard is to understand which type of customers are buying bikes and what patterns are present in the data.

What I have done in this project:
I cleaned the data and created a helper sheet to calculate important values.

I made KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like:
Total number of customers
Number of customers who purchased bikes
Percentage of customers who purchased bikes
Average age of customers who purchased bikes

These KPIs are static, which means they don’t change when we click on slicers, but still show the overall summary.

I used pivot tables and charts to show visuals like:
Purchases by gender, occupation, and other fields.
I added slicers to filter data based on fields like gender, marital status, occupation, etc.

I used basic VBA macros to hide and unhide sheets to make the dashboard look cleaner and more professional.

What this dashboard is showing:
This dashboard shows:

What type of customers are buying bikes
From which region or occupation more purchases are coming
What is the age group of buyers
Overall percentage of customers who purchased bikes

This kind of dashboard helps in understanding customer behavior and can be useful in marketing and sales decisions.

⚠️ Limitations
“Currently, KPIs are static and not linked dynamically to slicers. This will be improved in the next version.”
Limited use of VBA – only for sheet hiding/unhiding, not full automation.


🚀 Future Improvements
Make KPIs fully dynamic using advanced formulas.
Explore more advanced VBA macros for automating dashboard refresh and slicer reset.
Integrate conditional formatting to make visuals more responsive.
Possibly recreate dashboard in Power BI for more interactivity.After exploring the excel fully and after getting good hands-on experience in excel.
